## [0.1.11] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- Added product-specific local BLE support for the V1 Smart Lock / Lock P1
  (`ms/7a4xvbtt`): battery, alarm, last-unlock method, Auto-Lock, Auto-Lock
  delay, read-only motor status, and a momentary Manual Lock action.
- Added focused mapping and S1 regression tests for Home Assistant 2026.7.4.

### Fixed

- Made `TuyaBLENumber` inherit Home Assistant's `NumberEntity` base class.

### Security

- Deliberately left V1 unlock unsupported because no verifiable DP 60/61
  pairing-key source is available; DP 33 remains exclusively Auto-Lock.
